## [Login Form (React)](https://vch-sh.github.io/react-login-form/) 
**Ctrl/Command** + click to open a link in a new window

The login form (includes validation of input data using regular expressions). After successful authorization, user can write notes in their account.

### While developing this project, I practiced the following:
* Component-based approach to React applications
* Reusability of React components
* Managing component state
* Creating controlled input fields
* Structure of a React project
* CSS modules
* Regular expressions (used for user authorization validation)
* Working with conditional operators (&&, ?) to display different content on the page
* Working with external npm packages
